5. A variable defined inside a function is a local variable; otherwise, it is a global variable.
If a local variable has the same name as a global variable, the local variable is used inside the function.
What does this print?

      def myFunc1():
        one = -1
        print(one, two)

      one = 1
      two = 2

      print(one, two)

      myFunc1()

      print(one, two)

Output: 
```
1 2
-1 2
1 2
```

As mentioned in the question, the 'one' variable in the myFunc1 function uses the local value so therefore, that print statment will be -1 2

6. The parameters in a function’s parameter list match up with and get their values from the arguments in the argument list of a function call in numerical order, not by parameter/argument name.

What does this print?

      def myFunc2 (one, two, three):
        print (one, two, three)

      one = 1
      two = 2
      three = 3

      print (one, two, three)

      myFunc2 (two, three, one)

      print (one, two, three)

Output:
```
1 2 3
2 3 1
1 2 3
```

The order of the parameters matter, not the argument name therefore, in the function call, two is one, three is two and one is three.

7. Eliminate global variables with main functions.
What does this print?

      def myFunc4(one, two, three):
        sum = (one + two) – three
        return sum

      def main():
        one = 1
        two = 2
        three = 3

        result = myFunc4(two, three, one)
        print(result)

      main()

Output:
```
4
```

As with the previous question the order is what determines how the parameters are assigned within the function.
